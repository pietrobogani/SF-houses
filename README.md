# Analysis of San Francisco Housing Market
## Methods and tools to act against gentrification and displacement

The San Francisco housing market has undergone significant changes in recent years, leading to increased gentrification and displacement of low-income and working-class families. To understand and address this pressing issue, we conducted a study aimed at finding practical solutions. Our goal was to gain insights into the phenomena of gentrification and displacement and to identify strategies for addressing them.

### Introduction

Gentrification is a process that transforms the socio-economic character of a neighborhood, often driven by the influx of wealthier individuals who push out and displace the current residents. In San Francisco, the booming tech industry and demand for housing by tech workers has fueled a significant rise in housing prices, making it increasingly difficult for low-income and working-class families to afford to live in the city.
The consequences of gentrification and displacement are far-reaching and have negatively impacted the social demographic structure of the city. San Francisco has become one of the most expensive cities in the US, leading to a shift in its population and the displacement of long-time residents.
In light of these developments, it is crucial to find practical solutions to curb gentrification and displacement in San Francisco and other cities facing similar challenges. Our study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of these phenomena and offers strategies for addressing them.


### Methodology

Our study focuses on the years 2011-2018.
For this analysis we used data on rent prices, evictions and new constructions.
In the first part of our study we focused our attention on understanding how the San Francisco housing market has changed in the latest years. In particular, we explored the main trends of rent prices and evictions through a functional perspective and by visualizing data in maps.
In the second part of the study, several semi parametric models have been designed. The models were firstly developed at a neighborhood granularity (data aggregated at a neighborhood level) and were later modified to be implemented at a parcel granularity, allowing to focus on the local effect, down to only 100m. The aim is to understand how the number of new houses built affects over time the rent prices and the evictions.
Building new housing is controversial because its impact on rents and rates of displacement and gentrification nearby is ambiguous. Increasing the housing supply could ground soaring housing prices and slow demographic change. However, building new, high-quality housing could also increase demand for nearby housing by improving neighborhood quality. If these demand effects are larger than the supply effects, new construction could accelerate local displacement. We call this phenomena “renovation effect” vs “supply effect”. The results provide precious guidance for the local government to implement the proper policies to address the phenomena of gentrification and displacement.
